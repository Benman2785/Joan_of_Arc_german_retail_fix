# Joan_of_Arc_german_retail_fix
Retailversion of "Joan of Arc" (2004) in german had its ingame speech removed

i used the "STD.SET" file provided from STEAM version of Game to enable english ingame speech in german Version
should work fine even with a different "WAVE.RES" - will test this with spanish version (as this was properly translated with audio)

you can edit the orginal file on your own - lines 60,61 and 68 are the important ones
